## Project Information

### About
This project aims to be a introduction to the wonderful world of virtualization.
We had to create our first machine in VirtualBox under specific instructions.
Then, at the end of this project, we had to be able to set up our own operating system while implementing strict rules.

### Evaluation
We only had to turn in a signature.txt file with the signature of our machineâ€™s virtual disk.
During the defense, we were asked a few questions about the chosen operating system, the use of SSH, the firewall configuration, creation of new users and assign them to a group, etc.
We also had to create a simple script called monitoring.sh, developed in bash, to display some information on all terminals every 10 minutes.
During the defense, we were also asked to explain how this script works and to interrupt it without modifying it.
